### **One-line Summary (Topic of Jira):**
"Requirement to Pull Latest Records by Reporting Timestamp for MAS Outstanding Report"

### **Issue Type:**
- Requirement
- Technology

### **Operations and Technology Requirements:**

#### **Operations Requirements:**
1. **Data Retrieval:**
   - Ensure that the MAS Outstanding Report retrieves only the most recent records based on the latest `Reporting Timestamp`.
   
2. **Data Accuracy:**
   - All data pulled for the MAS report must adhere to regulatory compliance, reflecting accurate and up-to-date reporting figures.
   
3. **Schedule and Automation:**
   - Implement a mechanism for automatically pulling the data at the required intervals, ensuring the latest timestamp is always used.
   - Ensure manual retrieval is available as a fallback for audit or emergency purposes.

4. **Audit Trail:**
   - Maintain an audit trail for the records retrieved to verify which `Reporting Timestamp` was used for generating the reports.

5. **Access and Controls:**
   - Ensure proper access controls are in place, limiting report generation to authorized personnel only.

#### **Technology Requirements:**
1. **Data Query Enhancement:**
   - Modify the existing data retrieval query or ETL process to filter and pull records based on the latest `Reporting Timestamp` for MAS Outstanding Report.
   - Ensure the query efficiently handles large datasets.

2. **Database and System Integration:**
   - Confirm that the reporting database contains a field for `Reporting Timestamp` and that this field is indexed to optimize performance for querying the latest records.

3. **Performance Monitoring:**
   - Implement system monitoring to ensure that the query is performant and that pulling the latest records doesn't impact the system's response time.

4. **Automation Support:**
   - Automate the extraction of the latest records at scheduled intervals through scheduled jobs or scripts.
   - Create a rollback mechanism for manual data extraction in case of system failures.

5. **Error Handling:**
   - Set up error handling and alerting in case there are issues with fetching the latest `Reporting Timestamp` or if the process fails to retrieve data.
