To measure my success in focusing on businesses and projects where we can excel, I concentrate on the following key metrics:

1. **Quality Metrics**: I assess product and service quality through client feedback and performance indicators, ensuring we meet high standards.

2. **Value Generation**: I evaluate how well our initiatives align with strategic priorities and contribute to overall business value.

3. **Root-Cause Resolution**: I track the effectiveness of solutions implemented to address issues at their source, aiming for sustainable outcomes.

4. **Client Relationship Growth**: I measure the strength and longevity of client relationships through retention rates and repeat business.

5. **Reputation Enhancement**: I monitor changes in our reputation via stakeholder feedback and industry recognition, focusing on positive impact.

6. **Environmental and Community Impact**: I assess our contributions to the environment and local communities, tracking initiatives that promote sustainability.

7. **Risk and Control Compliance**: I ensure that all projects meet risk management and control requirements, reducing potential liabilities.

These metrics help me gauge the effectiveness of my efforts in delivering quality outcomes that drive long-term success.
